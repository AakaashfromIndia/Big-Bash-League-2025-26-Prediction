This repository contains machine learning models developed to predict the winners of matches in the Australian Big Bash League (BBL) and Womenâ€™s Big Bash League (WBBL). The models use detailed cricket match data, player statistics, and venue information to provide probabilistic predictions for upcoming matches.

Multiple Model Training - Trains and evaluates several supervised ML models:
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - Gradient Boosting Classifier
 - Logistic Regression
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

An Ensemble Model combines multiple models (excluding neural net) into a VotingClassifier ensemble for robust predictions.

# Final predictions:
